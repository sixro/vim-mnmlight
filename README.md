## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
I liked using dark colorscheme in vim and in others IDE for all my file.  
Unfortunately after 30 years I started having issues with my eyes.  
I realised that looking at a black screen was painful for my eyes, while having it with a white background was far better.  
Because I do not like the screens with so many colors, I created this minimalist light colorscheme.  
I created it for me, but if someone else need something like this, you're welcome.  

I customized a little bit the scheme for the major filetypes I am using at the moment: `.java` and `.md` (markdown).
