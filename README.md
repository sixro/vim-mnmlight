## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
I liked using dark colorscheme in vim and in others IDE for all my file.  
Unfortunately after 30 years I started having issues with my eyes.  
I realised that looking at a black screen was painful for my eyes, while having it with a white background was far better.  

Because I do not like the screens with so many colors, I created this minimalist light colorscheme.  
I created it for me, but if someone else need something like this, you're welcome.  

I customized a little bit the scheme for the major filetypes I am using at the moment: `.java` and `.md` (markdown).

I have to thanks a Stackoverflow user named [romainl](https://stackoverflow.com/users/546861/romainl), 
because he helped me in [fixing some issues with colors I had on markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67658596/how-to-change-colors-of-local-anchors-in-headers).
